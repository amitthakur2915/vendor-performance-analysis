# Vendor Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance using sales, purchase, and inventory-related data.  
The objective is to evaluate vendors based on key metrics such as sales contribution, purchase value, and overall performance trends to support better business decision-making.

This project simulates a real-world data analyst scenario where raw data is processed, analyzed, and summarized using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze vendor-wise sales and purchase data
- Identify top-performing and low-performing vendors
- Generate insights for vendor comparison
- Build reusable scripts for data ingestion and analysis
- Present results using notebooks and dashboards

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Git & GitHub
- CSV-based data processing

## ⚠️ Dataset Information (Important)
The raw dataset used in this project was **very large in size (hundreds of MBs / GBs)**.

📌 **Due to GitHub file size limitations and industry best practices**, the raw data files have **not been uploaded** to this repository.

✔️ Only analysis code, notebooks, scripts, and reports are included  
✔️ Raw datasets are intentionally excluded using `.gitignore`

This reflects a **real-world professional workflow**, where large datasets are stored separately and code is version-controlled.

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility
To reproduce this project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Place the required CSV datasets in a local `data/` folder
3. Run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory
4. Execute scripts from the `scripts/` folder if required

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates:
- Practical data analysis workflow
- Handling large datasets responsibly
- Clean GitHub repository management
- Industry-level project structuring
